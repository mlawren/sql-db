0.19_1 (2011-03-08)

    API Changes:
        - This is a major rewrite, almost to the point where the
          SQL::DB name should change. However, since *all* releases
          have been DEVELOPMENT and there have never been any
          expectations of stability, and there are no known users apart
          from myself, I don't think there are going to be any issues.

    New Features:
        - N/A

    Enhancements:
        - N/A

    Bug Fixes:
        - N/A
